"Handling exceptions in Python a cleaner way, using Decorators",The Startup,https://medium.com/swlh/handling-exceptions-in-python-a-cleaner-way-using-decorators-fae22aa0abec,Shivam Batra,137,3,338,"Functions in Python are first class objects, which means they can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, and return from another function and store that in any data structure.As you can see we have assigned example_function to some_variable which makes some_variable callable. The output for the following will be:The first class object property of function helps us to use the concept of Decorators in Python. Decorators are functions which take as argument another function as an object, which enables us to put our logic either at the start and end of the execution of the argument function.As you can see we are using the decorator by using @decorator_example on top of the function which needs to be passed as the argument to the Decorator function. In this case, some_function will be passed as an argument to decorator_example. The output of the above snippet will be:You can use Decorators for quite a lot of purposes like logging, validations, or any other common logic which needs to be put in multiple functions. One of the many areas where Decorators can be used is the exception handling.Let’s take an example of such functions, which require handling of the same exceptions. We will take a simple example of calculating areas. And we will be for now printing the errors if an unsupported type is passed as the argument which in this case will be a string.Errors should never pass silently.Unless explicitly silenced.The normal way to do this would be to have all such functions in a try-catch, somewhat like this,Now, this looks repetitive which we should avoid to the extent we can. So we can use the magic of Decorators here and observe that the code looks a lot cleaner this way. And a clean code goes a long way.The output of the following will be:We can extend the capability of raising errors in the exception_handler by having custom exceptions and further expand its usages. This was one of the examples which enables us to handle the exceptions cleanly.",18/05/2020,16,7,0,7,700,468,1,0,0,0,1521
20 Entertaining Uses of ChatGPT You Never Knew Were Possible,,https://medium.com/@markwschaefer/20-entertaining-uses-of-chatgpt-you-never-knew-were-possible-3bc2644d4507,Mark Schaefer,27000,12,2163,"Our RISE community has been on fire, exploring the breathtaking possibilities of ChatGPT. The uses of ChatGPT are simply endless and intoxicatingIt’s still early days. Companies are trying to figure out the legal and ethical implications of a content world suddenly turned on its head by artificial intelligence. And yet … applying powerful AI to everyday tasks is awesome.So I challenged my RISE community friends … let’s have some fun and come up with some non-obvious uses and share them with the world.Here we go.Jim MacLeod asked ChatGPT to create a Twitter thread for him on the subject of design.Giuseppe Fratoni wants to write a novel.“Wow, this thing is unbelievable! I’m speechless. I literally asked the first thing I could think of, combining three of my passions: writing, mystery novels, and jazz.“The request was: “Develop a plot for a mystery novel where a disillusioned homicide detective hunts a clever serial killer who preys on musicians who perform the jazz standard Autumn Leaves”.“Here’s what I got:Detective James Thompson is a seasoned veteran of the Homicide department, but lately he’s been feeling burnt out and disillusioned. His latest case, the murder of a young jazz pianist who was found brutally killed in his home, only serves to deepen his sense of despair … (much more provided)Richard Bliss suggests:You have a guest speaker coming to your event and you are going to want to ask questions from the audience…have ChatGPT pre-generate some of the questions for you. The moderator can say, “And here’s a question for you from our AI?”For example, the conference is about water scarcity in the US West. The speaker is an expert on water management. Here was my query to the AI…What questions should I ask an expert on desalination and its impact?ChatGPT responded with…Richard is also a well-known expert in board games. He suggests that ChatGPT could be used to plot out and design new games. Note: Some people have started getting help solving crossword puzzle clues.Tanya Thompson thinks it could help with dating. ChatGPT says:If you’re looking to add a little flirtation to your first message on a dating app, here are a few ideas to get you started:We have all found ChatGPT excelling at one-on-on conversations.PepperBrooks provided this input: “I’m really sad and lonely right now.”ChatGPT: I’m sorry to hear that you’re feeling sad and lonely. It’s natural to feel down sometimes, but it’s important to remember that you’re not alone. There are many people who care about you and want to help you. It can be helpful to talk to someone about your feelings, whether it’s a close friend, family member, or mental health professional.Sometimes, just expressing your thoughts and emotions to someone else can help to alleviate your sadness and loneliness. It’s also important to take care of yourself and do things that make you happy, such as spending time with loved ones, pursuing a hobby, or exercising. These things can help to improve your mood and make you feel more connected to others. Remember that you are strong and capable, and that you can get through this difficult time.Daniel Nestle said: I thought ChatGPT could be used therapeutically, so I asked it to generate journal prompts to help me deal with anxiety:Daniel continued:Another use I thought of is naming ideas.Me: Help me come up with a name for a new drink. It’s got Japanese gin, unsweetened tonic, lime, Szechuan pepper, and grapefruit.ChatGPT: How about “Sakura Sunrise?” The name incorporates the Japanese gin and the citrus flavors of grapefruit and lime, and the word “sunrise” suggests a fresh and invigorating start to the day. Alternatively, you could go with something like “Peppered Grapefruit Gin Fizz” to emphasize the unique flavor combination of Szechuan pepper and grapefruit.Lisa Monks suggests: You can use ChatGPT on your mobile, so it is a perfect translation tool. Say for example you are traveling in Italy and you need help:ME: Translate the following into Italian My car is nearly out of fuel, can you tell me where the nearest petrol station is?ChatGPT: “La mia auto sta per esaurire il carburante, mi puoi dire dove si trova la stazione di servizio più vicina?”Lisa Monks also added:ME: I wish to be able to run 5km in 3 months’ time. Outline a running plan for me to be able to achieve thisChatGPt: Here is a running plan that can help you run 5km in 3 months:Spencer Crandall had a great time-saving idea!This morning I was thinking about who has the most difficult job in the world. Teachers.Too many students, not enough time. What if they could offload lesson planning stuff to ChatGPT? I gave it a try and this is what it provided.Lesson Title: The History and Impact of Artificial IntelligenceObjective: Students will understand the history and development of artificial intelligence and will be able to identify and discuss the potential positive and negative impacts of AI on society.Materials: * A timeline of significant events in the history of AI * Examples of AI technologies and applicationsLesson Outline:Joeri Billast contributed this one:ME: Who are ideal guests for my Web3 marketing podcast?ChatGPT: Ideal guests for your Web3 marketing podcast could include industry experts, influencers, and thought leaders in the Web3 marketing space. These could include digital marketers, content creators, business owners, entrepreneurs, and technologists who are active in the Web3 marketing space. You could also invite representatives from Web3-related startups and organizations to be a guest on your podcast.ME: Can you give me examples?ChatGPT: Some examples of ideal guests for your Web3 marketing podcast could include:Lisa Monk thinks ChatGPT can help overwhelmed retail staffs respond to social media issues.She asked ChatGPT to “respond to this restaurant review:”POSITIVE CUSTOMER REVIEW: I absolutely love this place. We eat out a lot however this place has topped it all. Perfect meals, amazing staff and the timing for it all was great! Special thanks to Sophie B (you rock) From your guests all the way from the Gold Coast, THANK YOUChatGPT REPLY: Thank you so much for your kind words and for taking the time to write a review. We are delighted to hear that you had such a great experience at our restaurant. We are thrilled that you enjoyed your meal and the service provided by Sophie. It’s always a pleasure to serve guests visiting from the Gold Coast and we are grateful for your support. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Thank you again for your positive review.CUSTOMER REVIEW: Most average food, there is a nice view, But that’s about itChatGPT: Thank you for your review. We apologize if your dining experience was not up to your expectations. We strive to provide top-quality food and service to all of our customers, and we will take your feedback into consideration as we continue to improve. Thank you for letting us know about your experience.Zack Seipert said: “I researched some famous unsolved murders and ChatGPT did an excellent job laying out the crime, suspects, clues and more. I bet that working with a team of experienced detectives some of these cold cases could be solved.”Author Joanne Taylor knows how difficult it is to separate embedded biases in her writing. In this post, she asked ChatGPT for help with ideas.Specifically, I asked ChatGPT to check a text I entered for racial bias and it seemed to do an excellent job.From Spencer Crandall: I used ChatGPT together with MidJourney to design a small, unique table. After ChatGPT created the idea, I edited it for clarity and brevity and input it into MidJourney.Here are the results:In an absolutely amazing demonstration of this technology, Scott Scowcoft led ChatCPT through iterations of a story text that led to individual frames of a serialized novel. You can view this here.I was invited on to a podcast about the future of sales. While this is closely related to marketing, it’s a little out of my natural element. So I asked ChatGPT to help me think through an interview about the future of sales. It responded:Sure, here are a few potential questions you may be asked in an interview about the future of the sales profession and suggestions for how to answer them:How do you think technology will impact the sales profession in the coming years? In the coming years, technology is likely to have a significant impact on the sales profession. Some potential ways that technology could impact the sales profession include the increasing use of automation and artificial intelligence to handle routine tasks and the increasing importance of data analysis and customer relationship management tools. Additionally, the rise of e-commerce and online sales channels is likely to continue to reshape the sales landscape.How do you think the role of the salesperson will change in the future? In the future, the role of the salesperson is likely to evolve in response to changing customer needs and expectations. Salespeople will need to be more knowledgeable and consultative in their approach, and will need to be able to help customers navigate complex product and service offerings. Additionally, the increasing importance of data analysis and customer relationship management tools will likely require salespeople to have a stronger understanding of technology and be able to use it effectively in their work.What skills do you think will be most important for sales professionals to have in the future? In the future, sales professionals will need a variety of skills to succeed. In addition to strong communication and interpersonal skills, sales professionals will need to be highly knowledgeable about the products and services they are selling, and be able to use data analysis and customer relationship management tools effectively. Additionally, the ability to adapt to changing customer needs and the ability to continuously learn and stay up-to-date on industry trends will be important for success in the sales profession.I don’t know what to buy my wife for Christmas. I asked:Suggest a gift idea under $200 for a middle-aged woman who loves The Eagles.Answer: One potential gift idea for a middle-aged woman who loves The Eagles is a vinyl record of one of their classic albums, such as “Hotel California” or “The Long Run.” Vinyl records have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, and many music fans appreciate the unique sound and experience of listening to music on vinyl.You could also consider pairing the vinyl record with a high-quality record player for a complete gift package. This type of gift is likely to be appreciated by a fan of The Eagles, and the combination of the vinyl record and record player is likely to be within your budget of $200.I entered: Explain quantum physics to me as if I were 10 years old.Quantum physics is a branch of science that studies how tiny particles, like atoms and subatomic particles, behave. These particles are so small that they don’t always follow the same rules as the things we can see and touch every day.For example, sometimes they can be in two places at the same time, or they can be friends with each other even if they are far apart. This might sound strange, but it’s what scientists have learned from studying these tiny particles. Quantum physics helps us understand how the world works at a very small scale, and it can also help us make new technologies, like computers that are much faster than the ones we have today.Most blogs, journals, and books follow AP Style guidelines. I asked ChatGPT to “edit the following text using AP Style Guidelines,” and it did a perfect job.Oh … and then there was this. “Write a powerful headline for a blog post featuring 16 inventive and entertaining uses of ChatGPT”Here are a few potential headlines for a blog post featuring 20 inventive and entertaining uses of ChatGPT:In an earlier post, I contended that ChatGPT will profoundly change marketing and marketing careers forever. I have never made a statement like that in my life. Even in the early days of the internet, there was a lot of “wait and seeing” going on!But this technology was just introduced to the public two weeks ago, and more than a million people are now using it, the fastest technology adoption in history, by far.Today’s post provides inventive and entertaining ideas to inspire you, but it is not even scratching the surface. ChatGPT is writing code, composing music, writing research papers, and so much more.Have you tried it? What have you learned?

"Say Goodbye to Loops in Python, and Welcome Vectorization!",CodeX,https://medium.com/codex/say-goodbye-to-loops-in-python-and-welcome-vectorization-e4df66615a52,Anmol Tomar,4000,5,596,"Loops come to us naturally, we learn about Loops in almost all programming languages. So, by default, we start implementing loops whenever there is a repetitive operation. But when we work with a large number of iterations (millions/billions of rows), using loops is a crime. You might be stuck for hours, to later realize that it won’t work. This is where implementing Vectorisation in python becomes super crucial.What is Vectorization?Vectorization is the technique of implementing (NumPy) array operations on a dataset. In the background, it applies the operations to all the elements of an array or series in one go (unlike a ‘for’ loop that manipulates one row at a time).In this blog, we will look at some of the use cases where we can easily replace python loops with Vectorization. This will help you save time and become more skillful in coding.First, we will look at a fundamental example of finding the sum of numbers using loops and Vectorization in python.Using LoopsUsing VectorizationVectorization took ~18x lesser time to execute as compared to the iteration using the range function. This difference will become more significant while working with Pandas DataFrame.In Data Science, while working with Pandas DataFrame, the developers use loops to create new derived columns using mathematical operations.In the following example, we can see how easily the loops can be replaced with Vectorization for such use cases.Creating the DataFrameThe DataFrame is tabular data in the form of rows and columns.We are creating a pandas DataFrame having 5 Million rows and 4 columns filled with random values between 0 and 50.We will create a new column ‘ratio’ to find the ratio of the column ‘d’ and ‘c’.Using LoopsUsing VectorizationWe can see a significant improvement with DataFrame, the time taken by the Vectorization operation is almost 1000x faster as compared to the loops in python.We implement a lot of operations that require us to use the ‘If-else’ type of logic. We can easily replace these logics with Vectorization operations in python.Let’s look at the following example to understand it better (we will be using the DataFrame that we created in use case 2):Imagine we want to create a new column ‘e’ based on some conditions on the exiting column ‘a’.Using LoopsUsing VectorizationTime taken by the Vectorization operation is 600x faster as compared to the python loops with if-else statements.Deep Learning requires us to solve multiple complex equations and that too for millions and billions of rows. Running loops in Python to solve these equations is very slow and Vectorization is the optimal solution.For example, to calculate the value of y for millions of rows in the following equation of multi-linear regression:we can replace loops with Vectorization.The values of m1,m2,m3… are determined by solving the above equation using millions of values corresponding to x1,x2,x3… (for simplicity, we will just look at a simple multiplication step)Creating the DataUsing LoopsUsing VectorizationThe np.dot implements Vectorized matrix multiplication in the backend. It is 165x faster as compared to loops in python.Vectorization in python is super fast and should be preferred over loops, whenever we are working with very large datasets.Start implementing it over time and you will become comfortable with thinking along the lines of vectorization of your codes.You can get all my posts in your inbox.

"Hey ChatGPT, Automate These Tasks Using Python",Geek Culture,https://medium.com/geekculture/hey-chatgpt-solve-these-coding-tasks-using-python-b2e7482f2c18,Frank Andrade,23000,6,569,"Recently ChatGPT was released. This is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI that specializes in dialogue. Its goal is to make AI systems more natural to interact with, but it can also help you when writing code.You can make ChatGPT your coding assistant or even go beyond that!I’ve been playing with ChatGPT a bit over the past few days. Here are some tasks I gave ChatGPT ordered by difficulty (spoiler alert: I was amazed at the results)If you want to plot a linear regression, you can simply tell ChatGPT:plot a linear regression with Python using matplotlibWe can be very specific by telling ChatGPT the library it should use, otherwise, it’ll choose itself.Here’s the Python code created by ChatGPT (with comments included!)And here’s the output.This was an easy one, so let’s try something a bit more difficult.I was curious to see if ChatGPT could help us with third-party libraries such as pywhatkit. This library allows us to send messages using Whatsapp.send a message on Whatsapp using Python and pywhatkitFor the sake of this article, I didn’t go one step further by telling ChatGPT my phone number or the message I wanted to send (I did something like this for task #3 though).Here’s the Python code created by ChatGPT.In addition to the code generated by ChatGPT, you have to have a WhatsApp session opened in your browser and have pywhatkit installed (more info here)There are hundreds of code snippets on the internet that show you how to send an email with Python. You can go one step further with ChatGPT:send an email from “email_1” to “email_2” with the subject “Email sent by ChatGPT” and the content “ChatGPT rocks!” using PythonHere’s the code:After typing the code, ChatGPT tells us that we should introduce our password in the “YOUR_PASSWORD” placeholder.Something that ChatGPT didn’t tell us this time (it does sometimes) was that we have to turn on 2-step verification to get a 16-character password in case we’re using Gmail (more info about this in my YouTube video tutorial)Anyway, ChatGPT did an amazing job. After typing my password, I got the email:Probably the most challenging task I gave ChatGPT was to scrape a website. As you might know, websites have different HTML, so the steps to scrape websites change from site to site.ChatGPT did a great job scraping the name of books and prices of a site called books.toscrape.comweb scrape https://books.toscrape.com/ using Python and beautiful soupHere’s the code.And here’s the data extracted.Extracting data without writing code myself … amazing!For those into Excel automation, I also made ChatGPT generate an excel report.I couldn’t come up with a good idea to make ChatGPT help me with automating Excel reports, so I only tried this.generate an Excel report with PythonHere’s the code generated.And here’s the output:As you can see, I only got a simple template, but I believe that you only need to give ChatGPT the right command to get impressive results.Now it’s your time to play with ChatGPT!Learning Data Science with Python?

I asked Chat GPT to build a To-Do app — Have we finally met our replacement?,Bits and Pieces,https://medium.com/bitsrc/i-asked-chat-gpt-to-build-a-to-do-app-have-we-finally-met-our-replacement-ad347ad74c51,Fernando Doglio,7100,7,1147,"We saw the release of GitHub Copilot in October of 2021 and the whole dev community went crazy.Some were claiming that we would soon be left out of a job, and others, like me, thought that while the tool was interesting, it was really far from a replacement. It could provide better autocomplete, yes, but it was not capable of creating an entire app for you.So we were safe.Or so we thought.A few weeks ago we saw the release of Chat GPT and the entire dev community went crazy again. But are they right this time around?I tried the AI and I asked it to build the web dev equivalent of a “Hello world”: a To-Do app.Let’s see how it did.Here are my prompts for the chatbot and the answers I got:can you give me the code to create a to-do app that allows me to edit the items and store them in a database? Please use React for the front-end and next js for the back-endThat was my initial prompt, and the key asks are bolded there:Now, here is what I got:Ok, that wasn’t EXACTLY what I asked for.Yes, I got a to-do app, using React and Next, BUT, it’s not using a database, in fact, it’s using in-memory storage. And it’s not letting me edit the items. So let’s ask again.can you modify that code to add support for a cloud database?OK, now I just referenced “that code”, and added “cloud database” support. I was specifically trying to be vague, because a human would easily understand this, but the AI needs to keep a reference to the current conversation and remember what we’re talking about.And lo and behold, the code I asked for:It picked Firebase for me, and it even wrote the placeholders for me to enter my credentials.Or did it?So far, I’m pretty impressed with the results, I was not really expecting this level of detail.But when it came to testing the code, I found a couple of issues that clearly highlight the shortcomings of this bot.Issue #1: it was missing an import. Silly mistake, I know, we humans make them all the time, but the code was missing the import of the useEffect hook.Issue #2: it never specified the version of the firebase npm package to use. Maybe that was my fault, but a simple npm install firebase yielded a version that was not compatible with the code. So I asked the bot: what version of the firebase npm package should I use for that example?And I got an interesting answer:I mean, kudos to the bot, it was able to understand the context of my question, and provided a valid (almost) answer. The code was, indeed, compatible with that version of firebase, so I was able to try it.But the current version of Firebase is 9, not 7, that’s a problem.With those problems solved, I was able to test the app and get it to work.Oh, yes, I’m still missing the Edit button. Which is something I asked for, because not many tutorials cover that part of the app. They usually stick to adding and removing items.So what’s wrong here?Don’t get me wrong, Chat GPT is freaking awesome.Coupled with Dalle-2 and MidJourney, this is the most interesting and advanced piece of AI software I’ve ever tried.But it’s not about to replace developers.Why? Because of the two problems I highlighted above. If you haven’t picked up on it yet, the bot is simply spitting out content from articles used to train it.So instead of creating the code for itself, which should be flawless, it’s simply showing me what other authors have written. Not only that, but it’s also showing me outdated content with errors.That’s because it’s not capable of validating whether or not it’s indeed giving me what I asked for. Instead, it’s guessing (with a huge success rate) what I’m looking for, and giving me something that looks like it.In other words, at its current state, Chat GPT will only be useful as long as the content used to train it is verified, and kept updated by someone else.Did you like what you read?

Join “The Rambling of an old developer” !We’re simply looking at yet another tool that might come in handy for our daily work.How?Right now when you have a problem you input the issue on Google and 8 out of 10 times you land on StackOverflow.Now, you’ll be able to input the question directly on Chat GPT and most likely, it’ll give you the best-ranked answer from SO or some high-ranking article.Should you blindly trust the code returned by Chat GPT?No, you still have to use your brain. Sorry, not sorry.But it will give you a quick head start.In other words, the only thing that Chat GPT can do (at least right now) is to perform a faster Google search.Which, don’t get me wrong, with the number of times we perform Google searches every day, it will most likely come in handy.That said, it’s also true that Chat GPT will give you a single answer, which according to its algorithm, is the best one for you. But what about the rest? What about your own preferences?Chat GPT will hide all other options, effectively boosting the few it considers valid for its users.How good is that for content creators and people looking for options and alternatives? That’s for you to decide.Copilot has received some lawsuits because it’s spitting copyrighted code without properly crediting the authors.Will the same happen with Chat GPT? After all, as you’ve seen already, the bot is returning content from (what I assume to be) other creators without properly crediting them.Granted, the chat is currently free to use, so I don’t think there are any legal issues, but the moment they start charging for it (which already happened with Dalle-2) they will cause a legal battle, won’t they?After all, they would be essentially charging you for content that is readily available online for free and without crediting the proper authors.Chat GPT will not replace developers.(Edit by the author: here is a follow-up story about this same topic that will show you another point of view about this.)It will, at best, simplify your search process and help you find answers to your questions a lot faster.That is if it’s not shut down due to legal concerns once it goes into a paid plan.What do you think?
